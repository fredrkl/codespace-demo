# Codespace Demo

Small repo showing how to enable vs code plugins in your devcontainer.

## WSL 2

By installing Docker with the WSL 2 integration you can clone this repo into a WSL 2 directory, and when you open it VS Code will prompt you to start it in the devcontainer. The good part of this setup is that you can still controll your git locally with gpg, aliases etc.
